# Code of conduct

## Tech style

This here is pure tech style.  So there is no room for politics, sales, marketing nor management.

This means in particlular:

- To insist to stay politically correct is not tolerated.  If you reject something just because it is not politically correct, this is your fault.  Everything which is technically correct, but happens to be politically incorrect in some way, is not considered faulty.

- Trying to be sales friendly is not tolerated.  We are not doing this for others.  This is pure technical, for us, the tech, only the tech and nobody else than the tech.  If sales happens to follow the tech way this is ok.  But changing things to get a bit more sales friendly at the cost of some techical features, this simply is a bug which must be fixed, ASAP.

- Using marketing speak is not tolerated.  Never advertise.  Never polish.  Stick to just the facts.  Say the truth, always, fully.  Even if it incomfortable or not polite.

- Management decisions are not tolerated.  Techs are no managers.  Instead techs reach consensus.  You can?  You do!  That is it.  Just stick to the conduct.


## Rules

This gives us following rules:

- Rule 0: There are no negative rules.

- Rule 1: Lower rules overrule higher ones.

- Rule 2: Be tolerant, at least 101% of the time, except regarding to this conduct.

- Rule 3: Be truthful, at least 100% of the time.

- Rule 7: Hacker style is very welcome here.

- Rule 8: Internet (read: anarchy) style is welcome here.

- Rule 9: Use politics, sales, marketing or management phrases at last 0% of the time.

If you stick to this, everything is fine.

Notes:

- There are no negative rules, never make some up.

- Violation of this conduct is not tolerated.  We forgive, but not forget.

This is the `git` way.
